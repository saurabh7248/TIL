## Invert Matching
Don't we all like a nice joke, not !!!
We all find ourselves in condition, where we need to find things not containing something. The same can be achieved in grep through following command.

```
grep -v "Find all lines not containing this" <file_name>
```
-v: Options tells grep to invert the matching.
